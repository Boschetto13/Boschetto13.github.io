		<p> In the pictures above you can see both the friends I graduated high school with and the friends I spent the summer before college with. I'll never forget some of the priceless times Ive had with friends in the past. High school was a great experience due in large part to the people seen above. I shared so many laughs and good times with a lot of people in highschool and I look forward to getting to meet new people in college. Im excited to forge new relationships while still holding old friendships close to home.
