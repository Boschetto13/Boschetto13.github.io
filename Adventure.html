		<p> I am the type of person that is always looking for an adventure. I love to do new things and make experiences. Sometimes my adventures take me as far as the dominican republic, other times its exploring local trails.
		Above is a picture from my last big trip to the domincan republic. I was blessed to play baseball and experience new culture at the same time. It was one of the most impactful adventures I have been on to date.
