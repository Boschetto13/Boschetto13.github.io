		<h2> <B>Family:</B> </h2>
		<p> I was born and raised in a house of six. I had two loving and caring parents along with a younger sister and two brothers, one older and one younger. My mother was originally from Sanford, Maine; however, she later moved to massachusetts to attend Boston Univirsity. At Boston University she met my Father who was also a student. My father grew up in the boston area including West Roxbury and Shrewbury Massachusetts. My father is of Italian decent and has strong heritage that runs through his huge family. My mother on the otherhand is of French decent and has a small family. After getting married my parents decided to move to Wayland, Massachusetts where they had my two brothers, my Sister, and me. We currently live in Framingham, Massachusetts after moving last year. My older brother attends Umass Amherst while my other two siblings work their way through wayland school systems.
