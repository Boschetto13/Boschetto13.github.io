		<div class="article"> <p> Sports have been a huge part of my life and who I have been growing up. In high school I played football, hockey, and baseball. I was honored to receive captaincy in all three sports by my senior year. I learned so many valuable lessons through the ups and the downs of every season. Whether it was winning two north sectionals in hockey or going below 500 three years straight in baseball, there was always something to learn. Sports and the life lessons I have received from sports truly molded the person that I am today. Sports taught me respect, leadership, humilitaty, perseverance, and many more valuable characteristics </div>
